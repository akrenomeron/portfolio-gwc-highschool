    <h1>HI, I'M <span style="color: #f5debd">ALYSSA</span></h1>
    <p id="aboutMe">I currently live in Sacramento and will be going into my sophomore year. At school, I participate in academic decathlon, robotics, national honors society, and STEM club. I love to listen to music and watch movies and shows. One of my favorite movies is Inception and two of favorite shows are Glee and The Queen's Gambit. I love going ice skating and going to the movie theaters with my friends. In my free time, I enjoy baking and cooking for my family, and playing with my dog, PaoPao. At night, I like to relax by playing the piano or just laying in bed.  </p>
